Hi, I'm @lucasl36!  

Fullstack Developer with a focus on Backend. I stumbled into the programming field over 10 years ago, and today it is a passion. Professionally, I have worked with systems for tracking supplies, farm management, e-commerce, POS for retail and wholesale, as well as ERP.

In my most recent role, I took on the challenge of working at a national financial sector company, building scalable and secure APIs for mobile applications. My primary focus was ensuring data protection and providing an excellent experience for the end-user by delivering a secure and optimized system.

I have developed an interest in the DevOps and Architecture fields, deepening my knowledge of design patterns and infrastructure. In my free time, I work on personal projects with the goal of understanding the entire end-to-end software delivery process.
